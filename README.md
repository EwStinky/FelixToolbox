# FelixToolbox

Félix's Toolbox is a QGIS plugin designed to regroup multiple GIS-oriented python scripts that were created through time, for various professional projects, primarily stemming from a city-planning perspective. 
Félix's Toolbox provides intuitive features to facilitate various tasks that either do not exist in QGIS, or require several processes to be achieved.
The plugin contains several tools such as the creation of isochrones from several existing API, geocoding of addresses, or the location of specific business within a polygon. These tools are not necessarily related to each other, and are added throughout time,

## 🎁 Features

👉 **Isochrone ORS API**: Requests isochrones from the ORS (Openrouteservice) API, using point layers as input, and delivers the isochrones based on the processing mode selected by the user.

👉 **Isochrone IGN API**: Similar to the Isochrone ORS API tool, but limited to France and does not require any API key. It requests isochrones from the IGN (Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière) API for the selected layers and their parameters.

👉 **Itinerary IGN API**: Create itineraries by using the IGN Itinéraire API, between a departure and arrival layer for each point of each layer.
It is possible to filter the number of arrival points to create itineraries from by setting a maximal driving time from the departure points.
A single layer mode also exists, when enabled, use one layer as both departure and arrival points. The tool creates sequential itineraries based on a selected column (e.g., ID 1→2, 2→3). Optionally group by another column to process each group independently without cross-group connections.

👉 **Map Screenshot**: Instantly produces a map of your current QGIS instance view with all its active layers, with a personalized title and sources if needed.

👉 **Address to Point**: Geocodes addresses in your QGIS instance using the Nominatim API or the BAN API (France only) by writing addresses or by using a CSV file as input.

👉 **Siret located within polygon**: Produces a point layer of every active establishment located within a selected polygon. These establishments come from the SIRENE API (Système d’Identification du Répertoire des Entreprises et des Établissements). The API provides comprehensive, up-to-date information about companies, establishments, and self-employed individuals in France. A filter can also be applied if only specific types of businesses are selected by the user.
