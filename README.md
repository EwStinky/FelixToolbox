# FelixToolbox

F√©lix's Toolbox is a QGIS plugin designed to regroup multiple GIS-oriented python scripts that were created through the time, for various professional projects. 
F√©lix's Toolbox provides intuitive features to facilitate various tasks that either do not exist in QGIS, or require several processes.
Because it is not oriented on one specific topic, F√©lix's Toolbox contains several tools that are not necesseraly related to each other, and are added throughout time.

## üéÅ Features

üëâ **Isochrone ORS API**: Requests isochrones from the ORS (Openrouteservice) API for the selected point layers and their parameters, and then dissolve for each layer the isochrones per time unit.

üëâ **Isochrone IGN API**: Similar to the Isochrone ORS API tool, but limited to France and does not require any API key. It requests isochrones from the IGN (Institut national de l'information g√©ographique et foresti√®re) API for the selected layers and their parameters, and then dissolve for each layer the isochrones per time unit.

üëâ **Map Screenshot**: Produces instantly a map of your current QGIS instance view with all its active layers, with a personalized title and sources if needed.

üëâ **Address to Point**: Geocodes addresses from the Nominatim API or the BAN API (France only) by writing addresses or by using a CSV file.

üëâ **Siret located within polygon**: Produces a point layer of every active establishement located within a selected polygon. These establishements come from the SIRENE API (Syst√®me d‚ÄôIdentification du R√©pertoire des Entreprises et des √âtablissements). The API provides comprehensive, up-to-date information about companies, establishments, and self-employed individuals in France.
